# Free Code Camp - Tic-Tac-Toe
Online Tic-Tac-Toe Game


The Tic-Tac-Toe Game was my personal favorite from the FreeCodeCamp projects. First I was a bit afraid about designing the AI for the computer player, but as I kept thinking about it, and started by simple steps, I had more and more fun.
This part made me realize how useful JavaScript can be, and how colorful you
can control an app with it.
